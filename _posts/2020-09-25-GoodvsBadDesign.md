## Good vs. Bad Design

![Image of a bad design for an elevator.](/badElevator.jpg)

The image above is a poorly created design due to the signifiers of elevator buttons. The affordances of the object, elevator buttons, is to call the elevator to the right floor in the building. The constraints are that the elevator can only go in one direction, so the direction must be decided before the elevator arrives at the floor. Another constraint is one button only decides one way and the other button decides the other way, the button pressed decides the direction of the elevator. The reason this is a poor design is due to the signifiers. The signifiers for the elevator buttons aren't clear. The up button could be the button on top of the arrow or to the left, while the down button could be the button below the arrow or to the right. These signifiers make the affordances confusing and not a good design.

The design of the amazon website is good due to the clear signifiers which makes the design almost unnoticeable. The affordances of this site allow users to buy a variety of objects online for delivery. The constraints being that some objects might not be in stock. However, the signifiers clearly demonstrate the object's affordances. The clear search bar, and the street address, allow you to understand where to put your address for delivery, and where to search for objects. The interface is also good as it demonstrates each of the uses of the site as you click buttons, like clicking all in the search bar to choose the category of object you want to buy.
