## Fly On The Wall Lab

1a)  At Horace Mann, through the online school, I noticed many problems regarding the technology and software of zoom and the online school format. The problems can be grouped into two groups, technical problems and lifestyle problems. In the technical problems, one aspect is the audio. Problems surrounding audio refers to the sound input in zoom. Problems include mics being muted without knowing, the audio input prioritizing other sounds over voice, echo on mics, and mic feedback. The other aspect is the video. This refers to the video input, and problems include light overexposure in-camera and virtual background glitching. The second group of problems is the lifestyle problems. Like the technical problems, the lifestyle problems can be grouped into two aspects, a social aspect and a health aspect. A social aspect means the interactions between people through zoom. Problems with the social aspect include awkward silences, not knowing when to speak, and the isolating feeling surrounding quarantine, which also relates to the health aspect. The health aspect refers to the user's health when going through HM online. Problems include feeling depressed or less motivated due to quarantine, eye strain from screens, and headaches from being on calls all day.
    
1b)  At the campus the problems I observed all had to do with Covid-19. For this reason I grouped the problems in the Covid-19 group with two different aspects. These two different aspects are the interfenrence of Covid-19 in class or in social life. Interference of Covid-19 in class refers to changes needed to make in classes to accomidate the health guidelines of the pandemic. Problems include barriers muffling the voices of students and teachers during discussions, goggles in science lab fogging up, and classes neededing to end early. The second aspect has to do with social life on campus. This refers to how people interact with one another and how it is more difficult due to Covid-19. Problems include not recognizing people due to wearing masks, a maximum number of people regulation being placed in hangout locations, having to eat outside and not in group spaces, more littering outside due to a larger outside presence, and the lack of social distancing in some situations.

2a)  When examing the problems of HM online, most of the problems can be grouped up into an interactions group. More specifically interactions between sounds and the microphone. In online school, the microphone plays a curcuial role in relaying what a user says to the people they are saying it to. For students working microphones are a neccessity for online school, and can impact a student's grades and learning experience. Problems with microphone mostly include th eineteractions ebtween sounds the microphone. Problems like if the microphone is not picking up any noise, or is it prioritizing noises surrounding the mic over the voice of the user. Questions that can be asked include, is the online program interacting with the mic to regulate muting and unmuting? Or, does the proximity of the sounds affect the mic pickup? Another group of problems surround an object. This object is the screen and its effect on the health of users. The screen plays an important role in relaying information to the user on what website they are on and is an absolute necessity for everything from homework to class. However, the screen can have poor effects on the health. Examples include eye strain from the screen, headaches from the bright light, and lack of sleep from the blue light. I wonder if it is possible to decrease these effects from using a screen with a warmer tone to decrease blue light? An example of an app that does that would be f.lux which puts your screen on a warmer tone.

2b)  When examing the problems of Covid-19 on the campus, all the problems can be grouped into one cartegory. This category is the interactions of a user with other people. School is not only a time for learning, but also a time for being social and plays an important role in teaching children how to behave in public and how to interact with others. Since Covid-19 is making it more difficult for people to interact with one another, be it another student or a teacher, it has had a detrimental effect on the social life of school. An example of Covid-19 effecting interaction between people is people having problems communicating with one another due to masks and borders. Another example is the masks being detrimental to meeting and recognizing people as it covers most of someone's face. This can be especially detrimental to incoming freshman as it might make it harder for them to meet people and make new friends. Unfortunately, there aren't many solutions to these problems as masks and borders are needed to keep the school community healthy and prevent the spread of Covid-19. However, someone can ask the question of are there possible ways to improve interactions between people without violating the health guidelines? 

3. For this lab, although I couldn't work with anyone out of class due to the separation of online school, I was able to work with people in the class. In class, I was able to utilize the discussion activity and observe the problems with the technology and the experiences of people in the discussion. I was also able to use methods, mostly observing my peers over HM, but also sometimes asking questions, like asking my teacher about her problems in sending files over zoom. Due to the online structure, most methods work from observing to asking questions, but there did have to be some discussion to observe the problems.
