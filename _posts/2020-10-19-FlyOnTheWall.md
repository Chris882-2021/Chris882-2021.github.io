## Fly On The Wall Lab
1. At Horace Mann, through online school, I noticed many problems regarding the technology and software of zoom and the online school format. One section of problems have to do with the audio input and ouput. This includes with mics being muted without knowing, the audio input priotizing the sound of other things as opposed to the voice, echo on mics, and mic feedback. The other section of problems have to do with the video. Many people get headaches when staying on screens too long, eye strain due to screens, and also like light over exposure in camera, and virtual background glitching.

2. As stated in question one the problems can be associated into two different groups, an audio group, and a video/over exposure to screen group. Looking at the audio group and the problems in the audio group, some question can be made about the problems. This includes, what does the mic prioritize certain sounds over others? Is it the proximity of the sound, which is why it picks up typing, or does it use a voice recognition software. For the video group how does the overexposure work? How does the screen lightbalance the video input? And how doe sht ebright screen lead to eyestrain?
