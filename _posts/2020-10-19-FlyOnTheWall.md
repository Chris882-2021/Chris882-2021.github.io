## Fly On The Wall Lab
1. At Horace Mann, through the online school, I noticed many problems regarding the technology and software of zoom and the online school format. One section of problems has to do with the audio input and output. This includes mics being muted without knowing, the audio input prioritizing the sound of other things as opposed to the voice, echo on mics, and mic feedback. The other section of problems has to do with the video. Many people get headaches when staying on screens too long, eye strain due to screens, and also like light overexposure in-camera, and virtual background glitching.

2. As stated in question one the problems can be associated with two different groups, an audio group, and a video/over-exposure to screen group. Looking at the audio group and the problems in the audio group, some questions can be made about the problems. This includes, what does the mic prioritize certain sounds over others? Is it the proximity of the sound, which is why it picks up typing, or does it use a voice recognition software? For the video group, how does the overexposure work? How does the screen light balance the video input? And how does the bright screen lead to eyestrain?

3. For this lab, although I couldn't work with anyone out of class due to the separation of online school, I was able to work with people in the class. In class, I was able to utilize the discussion activity and observe the problems with the technology and the experiences of people in the discussion. I was also able to use methods, mostly observing my peers over HM, but also sometimes asking questions, like asking my teacher about her problems in sending files over zoom. Due to the online structure, most methods work from observing to asking questions, but there did have to be some discussion to observe the problems.
