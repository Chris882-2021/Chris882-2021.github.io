## Fly On The Wall Lab
1. 
  At Horace Mann, through the online school, I noticed many problems regarding the technology and software of zoom and the online school format. The problems can be grouped into two groups, technical problems and lifestyle problems. In the technical problems, one aspect is the audio. Problems surrounding audio refers to the sound input in zoom. Problems include mics being muted without knowing, the audio input prioritizing other sounds over voice, echo on mics, and mic feedback. The other aspect is the video. This refers to the video input, and problems include light overexposure in-camera and virtual background glitching. The second group of problems is the lifestyle problems. Like the technical problems, the lifestyle problems can be grouped into two aspects, a social aspect and a health aspect. A social aspect means the interactions between people through zoom. Problems with the social aspect include awkward silences, not knowing when to speak, and the isolating feeling surrounding quarantine, which also relates to the health aspect. The health aspect refers to the user's health when going through HM online. Problems include feeling depressed or less motivated due to quarantine, eye strain from screens, and headaches from being on calls all day.
    At the campus the problems I observed all had to do with Covid-19. For this reason I grouped the problems in the Covid-19 group with two different aspects. These two different aspects are the interfenrence of Covid-19 in class or in social life. Interference of Covid-19 in class refers to changes needed to make in classes to accomidate the health guidelines of the pandemic. Problems include barriers muffling the voices of students and teachers during discussions, goggles in science lab fogging up, and classes neededing to end early. The second aspect has to do with social life on campus. This refers to how people interact with one another and how it is more difficult due to Covid-19. Problems include not recognizing people due to wearing masks, a maximum number of people regulation being placed in hangout locations, having to eat outside and not in group spaces, more littering outside due to a larger outside presence, and the lack of social distancing in some situations.

2. As stated in question one the problems can be associated with two different groups, an audio group, and a video/over-exposure to screen group. Looking at the audio group and the problems in the audio group, some questions can be made about the problems. This includes, what does the mic prioritize certain sounds over others? Is it the proximity of the sound, which is why it picks up typing, or does it use a voice recognition software? For the video group, how does the overexposure work? How does the screen light balance the video input? And how does the bright screen lead to eyestrain?

3. For this lab, although I couldn't work with anyone out of class due to the separation of online school, I was able to work with people in the class. In class, I was able to utilize the discussion activity and observe the problems with the technology and the experiences of people in the discussion. I was also able to use methods, mostly observing my peers over HM, but also sometimes asking questions, like asking my teacher about her problems in sending files over zoom. Due to the online structure, most methods work from observing to asking questions, but there did have to be some discussion to observe the problems.
