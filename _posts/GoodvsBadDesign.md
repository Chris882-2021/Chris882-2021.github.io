## Good vs. Bad Design

![Image of a bad design for an elevator.](/badElevator.jpg)

The image above is a poorly created design for elevator buttons. The affordances of this object, elevator buttons, is to call the elevator to your floor to use it. The constraints are that the elevator can only go in one direction, so the direction must be decided before the elevator arrives at the floor. Another constraint is one button only decides one way, while the other button decides the other way. The reason for this being a poor design is due to the signifiers. The signifiers for the button and the button that controls which direction aren't clear. The up button could be the button on top of the arrow or to the left, while the down button could be the button below the arrow or to the right. These poor signifiers make it a poor design.

The design of the amazon is good due to the clear signifiers which makes that fact that it is a good design almost unnoticeable. The affordances of this site allow users to buy a variety of objects online for delivery. The constraints being that some objects might not be in stock. However, the signifiers clearly demonstrate the object's affordances. The buttons of all, in the search bar, and the street address, allow you to understand where to put your address for delivery, and where to search for objects. The interface is also good as it demonstrates each of the uses of the site as you scroll over buttons, like showing the categories of objects available in the site.
